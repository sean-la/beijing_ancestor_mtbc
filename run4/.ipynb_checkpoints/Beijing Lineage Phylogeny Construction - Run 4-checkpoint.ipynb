    "### 3 June 2016 ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data for this run are VCF files containing the SNPs from 110 unique strains from ~150 samples from the Beijing Lineage, where SNPs from repetitive regions and antibiotic-resistance were removed along with those whose frequency was less than 2. The entire list of strains used in this run can be found in the convertvcf folder in the file unique_strains.txt.\n",

    "#### VCF Conversion ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of VCF files were converted to FASTA file format with the tool convertvcf.py under the convertvcf folder with the following commands:\n",
